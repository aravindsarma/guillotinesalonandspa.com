	"p1": "The original \"Guillotine Headcutters\" opened its doors in 1970. The cutting stations depicted French guillotines and brought a rustic feel to the salon. It was one of the first hair salons to follow Sassoon's innovative hair cutting craze. The name \"Guillotine\" intrigued some, scared others, but nonetheless sparked curiosity in all.",
	"p2": "While keeping its captivating name, the second owner redesigned in the early 1980's and the salon took on a modern geometric black and white design.",
	"p3": "Lynne Fitzpatrick, the third and current owner since 1997, had been an employee for fifteen years before purchasing the salon. She was able to envision the true potential of the salon and saw the many different opportunities that she could offer her guests. In 2005, under Lynneâ€™s leadership, the salon expanded and was revamped into a comfortable and relaxing environment. It was converted from an ordinary hair cutting shop into the extraordinary salon and spa that it is today!",
